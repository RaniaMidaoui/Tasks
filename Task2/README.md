This application creates a 3D cube that you can rotate and zoom using the mouse and keyboard. It uses the freeglut library and most of the code provided (with slight changes). It utilizes OpenGL's depth buffer for proper 3D rendering.

The application stays open until the user closes the window and it is build using CMake.

To run the application: 

`./build/OpenGLApplication`
